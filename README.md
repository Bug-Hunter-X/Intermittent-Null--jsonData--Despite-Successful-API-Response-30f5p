# Intermittent Null 'jsonData' in Dart HTTP Request

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `jsonData` variable unexpectedly becomes null, even when the API call returns a successful HTTP status code (200) and valid JSON data. The issue is intermittent and difficult to consistently reproduce.

## Bug Description

The Dart code makes an HTTP GET request to an API endpoint.  Despite a successful response, `jsonDecode(response.body)` sometimes returns null, leading to unexpected null pointer exceptions.

## Solution

The provided solution improves error handling and includes more robust checks to ensure that the JSON decoding process is working correctly.
